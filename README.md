# Task 6: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

**Internship:** AI & ML Internship at Elevate Labs  
**Submitted by:** Jebin James  
**Dataset Used:** Iris Dataset (from sklearn.datasets)

## 🧠 Objective
Understand and implement KNN classification with different K values and analyze model performance.

## ✅ Steps Performed
- Loaded Iris dataset
- Standardized features
- Trained KNN models with K=1 to 20
- Evaluated models using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
- Visualized accuracy vs K
- Plotted decision boundary for 2 features

## 🏁 Result
- Best K Value: 5  
- Accuracy Achieved: ~96.6%  
- Clear classification with decision boundaries for 3 classes
